PROJECT BRIEF: AdPro
===================================

## App Concept

**Pitch:** A centralized platform for Malawian ad agencies to instantly find, price, and book available billboard advertising space in real-time.

**Description:** AdPro is a web application designed to streamline the fragmented billboard advertising process in Malawi. It connects both clients and the advertising agencies' teams with billboard owners, providing a dynamic marketplace to search inventory, get transparent, real-time pricing, and manage bookings efficiently. This eliminates the current pain points of manual inquiries, slow negotiations, and lack of visibility into ad space availability.

## 12-Month Development Roadmap

### Q1: Foundation & Prototyping
**Focus:** Deeply understand the Malawian ad market and design the core user experience.
**Milestones:**
- Conduct comprehensive market research: Interview 10+ Malawian ad agencies and billboard owners to identify pain points and ideal features.
- Define the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) feature set, focusing on instant pricing and real-time availability for a specific billboard type.
- Create detailed wireframes and high-fidelity UI/UX mockups for the MVP, leveraging your graphic design skills to envision a user-friendly platform.
- Design the core database schema for billboard inventory, locations, and pricing models, laying a solid technical foundation.

### Q2: Building the Engine & Gathering Data
**Focus:** Bring the MVP to life and populate it with initial, crucial inventory data.
**Milestones:**
- Develop the core web application (front-end and back-end) for the MVP, focusing on robust functionality and a clean user interface.
- Secure agreements with 5-7 early-adopter billboard owners/agencies to integrate their inventory data into 'AdPro'.
- Implement the dynamic search and instant pricing calculation functionalities, making the platform truly useful.
- Launch a simple, professional landing page to attract early interest and collect email sign-ups for beta access.

### Q3: User Validation & Pilot Program
**Focus:** Get 'AdPro' into the hands of real users for invaluable feedback and a controlled pilot.
**Milestones:**
- Conduct intensive internal testing and gather feedback from 3-5 friendly ad agencies, refining the user experience and squashing initial bugs.
- Implement critical feature improvements and UI/UX adjustments based on early user feedback, ensuring the app is intuitive and efficient.
- Launch a structured private beta program with 2-3 key Malawian ad agencies, closely monitoring their usage and collecting detailed input.
- Develop simple, clear onboarding guides and a basic FAQ section to support your early pilot users effectively.

### Q4: Market Launch & First Wins
**Focus:** Officially introduce 'AdPro' to the market and secure your foundational paying clients.
**Milestones:**
- Perform a final quality assurance check, addressing any remaining bugs and optimizing performance for a smooth public launch.
- Develop a focused go-to-market plan, including outreach strategies to Malawian ad agencies and compelling communication materials.
